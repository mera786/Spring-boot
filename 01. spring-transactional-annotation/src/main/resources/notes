Spring Transaction & @Transactional annotation:

            critical operations or code sections where problem arise ?
                 - code segment where shared resources are being accessed and modified.
                    {
                           read flight seat with id 1/2/..
                             if seatStatus is available
                                    update to booked
                     }
                - when multiple requests try to access this critical section, data inconsistency can happen.
               What is the solution?
                 Transaction.
 what is transaction ?
         - logical unit of work in which one or more operations are executed together.
         - help to achieve ACID Properties.

  Atomicity :
     - Ensures all operations in transaction are completely successfully, if any operation fails then entire transaction is rolled back.
     - eg : suppose u send 100rs to friend and from ur acc money debited but ur friend in ur frnd acc not credited so rolled back.

Consistency :
      - Ensure the DB state before and after transaction in consistent.
      - eg: no money send so both acc DB state is consistent no modification.

Isolation :
      - Ensure that, if multiple transactions are running in parallel, they do not interfere with each other.
      - eg : if same time u sending money and 1000 ppl also to ur frnd so it ennsure transaction interference.

 Durability :
       - Ensure that commited transaction will never be lost despite of system failures.

@Transactional :
       - @Transactional is Spring’s way to manage transactions automatically because it uses Spring AOP.
       - You don’t manually write: commit, rollback. Spring handles it for you.
       - Internally delegates transaction operations to a PlatformTransactionManager.
       - When Spring sees @Transactional:
                                  - It creates a proxy around your bean.
                                  - The proxy intercepts method calls.
                                  - The real object is NOT called directly
                                  - This is done using:
                                                   - JDK Dynamic Proxy (if interface exists)
                                                   - CGLIB Proxy (if no interface).
       - Where Can @Transactional Be Applied? :
                                - Method Level (Most Common).
                                - Class Level
                                     - @Transactional works ONLY on public methods :
                                                                                 Why?
                                                                                 Because Spring uses proxy-based AOP.
